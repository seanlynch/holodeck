# TODO

* Implement multiple levels of undo
* Make instruct templates config-based instead of hardcoded
* Factor out the LLM API API to make it easier to implement different APIs
* Implement [AI Horde](https://stablehorde.net/) support so normal
  people can use it
* Release the LLM APIs package separately so other people can use it,
  or find someone else's project and use that
* Turn it into a full-blown MUD engine or something
* Lots of other stuff

## DONE

* Factor out generation (in `llm_prompter.py`)
